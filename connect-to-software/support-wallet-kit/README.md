# Support Wallet Kits

If your project already uses a wallet aggregator/kit, you can keep using it and prioritize OneKey in their configuration. The following popular kits support OneKey:

- Web3 Onboard (EVM) — connect-to-software/support-wallet-kit/web3-onboard.md
- RainbowKit (EVM) — connect-to-software/support-wallet-kit/rainbowkit.md
- Web3Modal (EVM) — connect-to-software/support-wallet-kit/web3modal.md
- Aptos Wallet Adapter (Aptos) — connect-to-software/support-wallet-kit/aptos-wallet-adapter.md

For pure web without aggregators, see: connect-to-software/README.md (EIP‑1193 provider).
