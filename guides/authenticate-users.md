# Authenticate users

This guide shows how to use EIP‑4361 (Sign‑In with Ethereum) or a custom nonce‑based scheme to authenticate users with OneKey.

- Frontend: request a signature from the EIP‑1193 provider
- Backend: verify the signature and issue a session/JWT

> Coming soon. For now, see: connect-to-software/webapp-connect-onekey/eth/signing-data.md
